## Pulling for Power: A Computer Vision Analysis of Directional Hitting and Kinematic Consequences of Pull-Centric Swing Approaches 
Using a variety of computer vision models, 2d pose estimations of batters are uplifted to 3D, where biomechanical coordinates are then extracted 
to use in a functional data analysis mixed effects model. This model identifies kinematic differences between pulling inside and outside pitches,
which can be used to connect to on-field success.

What is currently in the works is linking on-field success to these kinematic differences. Thus, the code that is related to this is not in the
respository at the current moment, but will be in the near future once completed.
